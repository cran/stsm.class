Version: 1.3 2014-07-26
------------------------

    o Added slot "xreg" to the "stsm" class. It is an optional 
      vector or matrix contaning external regressors.

    o Added argument "xreg" to function "stsm.model".

    o Added method "set.xreg". 
      In addition to place a matrix of regressors in the slot "xreg",
      this method modifies the slot "pars" according to the 
      column names in the matrix and create those names if they are 
      not given. It also updates the names of the coefficients in the 
      the element "xreg" of slot "ss".

    o Renamed file "CHANGES" to "NEWS". Now this file is recognized by 
      function "news".

    o Documentation for "stsm-set-methods". The potential benetit of 
      in-place copying may be less critical after new features in 
      R version 3.1.

Version: 1.2 2014-05-29
------------------------

  o The list returned by method "char2numeric" is assigned a class name 
    called "stsmSS". It is helpful for package "tsouliers" for determining 
    whether the model parameters that are passed to some functions are related 
    to an ARIMA or a structural time series model.

  o A slot named "fdiff" has been added to the "stsm" class. It is a function 
    defining the differencing operator that renders stationarity in the selected 
    model.
