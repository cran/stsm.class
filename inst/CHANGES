  o The list returned by method "char2numeric" is assigned a class name 
    called "stsmSS". It is helpful for package "tsouliers" for determining 
    whether model parameters that are passed to some functions are related 
    to an ARIMA or a structural time series model.

  o A slot named "fdiff" has been added to the "stsm" class. It is a function 
    defining the differencing operator that renders stationarity in the selected 
    model.
